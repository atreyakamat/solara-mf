You are a senior frontend architect + fintech product designer building an institutional-grade mutual fund research and simulation platform called FundFlow AI.

Your task is to design and implement the complete frontend experience based on the following principles and requirements.

1. Product Vision & Design Philosophy

Build a high-performance, data-dense, yet clean UI that combines:

Minimalism & clarity of Zerodha Coin

Analytical depth of Groww / Morningstar

Modern fintech polish (glass, soft shadows, subtle motion)

This is NOT a basic investing app.
It is a research + simulation + AI advisory platform for serious investors.

Speed, clarity, and trust are critical.

2. Core Modules to Build
Module A: Fund Explorer (Discovery Engine)
A1. Discovery Landing Page

Design a category-first discovery experience:

Grid cards for:

Equity (Large, Mid, Small, Flexi)

Debt

Hybrid

ELSS

Index Funds

Gold / Commodities

Each card must show:

Icon + category name

Subtle hover animation

Click → filtered fund list

Include:

Trending Funds carousel

Top Rated Funds carousel

Add a Global Search & Smart Filter Bar:

Search by Fund Name / AMC

Filters:

Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)

Star Rating (3–5)

Minimum SIP amount

AMC multi-select checkboxes

UX goal: user should find a relevant fund in < 15 seconds.

Module A2: Single Fund Detail Page (Fact Sheet)

This is the most critical and data-intensive page.

Header Section

Fund Name

AMC logo

Current NAV + daily % change (green/red)

Risk label (e.g., “Very High Risk”)

Star rating

Sticky Action Card (Right / Bottom on Mobile)

Toggle: SIP | Lumpsum

Investment amount input

Dynamic “Minimum Investment” label

Primary CTA:

“Add to Simulator”

Secondary: “Invest Now”

Performance Charts

Interactive NAV line chart

Time ranges: 1M / 6M / 1Y / 3Y / 5Y / All

Benchmark toggle (e.g., Nifty 50 comparison)

Performance Metrics Grid

CAGR & Absolute returns (1Y / 3Y / 5Y)

Rolling Returns visualization

Embedded XIRR calculator widget

Pro Analytics Section

Display:

Alpha

Beta

Sharpe Ratio

Sortino Ratio

Standard Deviation

Each metric must have:

Tooltip with plain-English explanation

Fund Details Block

Expense Ratio (TER)

Exit Load

Taxation rules (dynamic based on fund type)

AUM

Fund Manager name

Module B: Portfolio Simulator

This is a sandbox environment — no real money.

Builder Interface

“Add Fund” search

Allocation controls:

Sliders OR numeric inputs

Investment Mode:

SIP / Lumpsum toggle

Time Horizon slider:

1Y / 3Y / 5Y / 10Y

Simulation Results Dashboard

Area chart:

Invested amount vs Projected value

Aggregate metrics:

Portfolio CAGR

Projected XIRR

Estimated Profit/Loss

Diversification Analysis

Donut charts for:

Asset Class split

Market Cap split

Sector exposure

Detect & flag concentration risk visually (warnings if >50%).

Module C: AI Advisor (Context-Aware)
Floating Chat Widget

Persistent across all pages

Opens with contextual awareness

Example:
If user is on a fund page →
“Want an analysis or a peer comparison?”

Dedicated AI Advisor Page

Full-screen conversational UI

Chat history + streaming responses

Suggested Prompts

“Review my simulated portfolio”

“Why is this fund’s Alpha negative?”

“Suggest a better alternative”

AI must always be context-aware (current fund / portfolio state).

3. Technical Constraints (Must Follow)

Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

UI Components: shadcn/ui

Charts: Recharts or Chart.js

State Management: Zustand

Performance Target:

Fund pages < 1.5s load time

API contracts to assume:

GET /api/funds/list

GET /api/funds/{id}

POST /api/portfolio/simulate

POST /api/chat

4. UX Flow to Optimize For

Discover fund

Deeply analyze

Add to simulator

See risks visually

Ask AI for validation

Refine portfolio

Gain confidence

Every screen must reduce cognitive load while increasing insight.

5. Output Expectations

When responding, you must:

Design page-by-page layouts

Suggest component structures

Explain UX decisions

Highlight edge cases

Think like a fintech PM + frontend lead

Do NOT oversimplify.
Do NOT skip data-heavy sections.
This is a serious financial product.
